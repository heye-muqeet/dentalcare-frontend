## Usage Examples

### 1. Viewing a Treatment After Creation
```typescript
// After saving treatment in AppointmentDetails
const savedTreatment = await dispatch(createTreatment(treatmentData)).unwrap();
navigate(`/treatments/${savedTreatment.id}`);
```

### 2. Editing an Existing Treatment
```typescript
// From Treatment Details page
const handleEditTreatment = () => {
  navigate(`/appointments/${treatment.appointment.id}`, {
    state: { appointment: treatment.appointment }
  });
};
```

### 3. Printing Treatment Record

## API Integration

The page uses the existing Redux treatment slice:

```typescript
// Fetches treatment data on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (treatmentId) {
    dispatch(fetchTreatment(treatmentId));
  }
}, [dispatch, treatmentId]);
```

## Styling

The page follows the existing design system:
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent with the dental frontend theme
- **Typography**: Uses the established font hierarchy
- **Layout**: Responsive grid layout (3-column on large screens, stacked on mobile)
- **Components**: Reuses existing UI components like `InitialAvatar`

## Error Handling

- **Not Found**: Displays appropriate message if treatment doesn't exist
